NSIS UAC Plugin v0.0.11d
------------------------

Purpose: to run on vista or higher the installed application
         at the end of the setup as a normal user and not as
         admin like the installer itself.

- UAC.nsh: has been modified to make the MessageBox
  (search for it case insensitive) silent compatible
  -> copy it to the Include directory of the NSIS installer
