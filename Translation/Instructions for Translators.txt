Hi,

I send you the instructions for translating the program.
Note that FreeVimager and ContaCam share the same code,
for this reason in the translation project there are
resources for both ContaCam and FreeVimager. If possible
please translate all of them.

How to proceed:

1. Download
http://www.contaware.com/downloads/appTranslatorTESetup.exe
http://www.contaware.com/downloads/ContaCam-X.Y.Z-LAN.zip
install the translation application and unzip the project file

2. Start the installed translator application and open the .apt
translation project file. Note: the .apt file and the executable of
the program to be translated have to be in the same directory

3. While translating you can resize/reposition the dialog controls
to make room for longer strings; use the search and replace feature,
especially for menus (there are duplicated items, it's normal)

4. Attention:
- If changing the menu short-cuts like Ctrl+P for printing,
  remember to update the values under both Menus and Accelerators
- In the String Table respect/keep the new lines

5. Press the Build Target File to create the output exe,
test it sometimes by double-clicking on it and
in File - Global Settings... dialog uncheck 'Start with Windows'
and uncheck 'Tray Icon'

6. When done send me back the .apt file

If you have any questions please feel free to contact me,
happy translating and thanks for helping,

Oliver
