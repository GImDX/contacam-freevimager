Note on DLGINIT resources problem:
----------------------------------

In DLGINIT all strings are stored as ANSI strings.
All others Windows resouces are stored as UNICODE strings.
DLGINIT items must be converted to the target language using a
specific code page. This is done correctly by AppTranslator.
It is required that the operating system has the same code page
when running the localized program.
For example if you localize your application to russian,
you can run it on an english Windows. All translations show correctly.
All but DLGINIT items, because those were saved as ANSI strings and have
been converted to the russian code page (1251). The english Windows has code page 1252.
It is recommended to not use DLGINIT at all, but populate list- and comboboxes
by resource strings at runtime (resource strings are allways UNICODE).


Note on synchronization:
------------------------

Always do the modifications to ContaCam.apt then backport to FreeVimager.apt
by making a copy of ContaCam.apt and renaming it to FreeVimager.apt.
Open the new FreeVimager.apt, update the source file and the
output files under the Module Properties. Save it and close.
Reopen FreeVimager.apt and call Update Source.
This way around because with ContaCam we can check all the resources.
FREEVIMAGER AND CONTACAM BOTH COMMITTED MEANS THEY ARE IN SYNC!


Instructions for translators:
-----------------------------

Hi,

I send you the instructions for translating the program.
Note that FreeVimager and ContaCam share the same code,
for this reason in the translation project there are
resources for both ContaCam and FreeVimager. If possible
please translate all of them.

How to proceed:

1. Download
http://www.contaware.com/downloads/appTranslatorTESetup.exe
http://www.contaware.com/downloads/ContaCam-3.1.0-SKY.zip
install the translation application and unzip the project file

2. Start the installed application and open the .apt
translation project file. Note: the .apt file and the program exe
have to be in the same directory (exe's ending 'w' stands for
wide chars = unicode)

3. While translating you can resize/reposition the dialog controls
to make room for longer strings; use the search and replace feature,
especially for menus (there are duplicated items, it's normal)

4. Attention:
- Please do not change the menu shortcuts like Ctrl+P for print,
you can change the Ctrl string but do not change the P!
- In the string table respect the new lines!

5. Press the Build Target File to create the output exe,
test it sometimes by double-clicking on it

6. When done send me back the .apt file

If you have any questions please feel free to contact me,
happy translating and thanks for helping,
