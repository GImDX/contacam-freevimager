Fully Support Unicode in Dialogs
--------------------------------

To Fully Support Unicode in CEdit we have to change the font of the dialog
using the control:
FONT 8, "MS Sans Serif", 0, 0, 0x1  ->  FONT 8, "MS Shell Dlg", 0, 0, 0x1


Note on DLGINIT resources problem
---------------------------------

In DLGINIT all strings are stored as ANSI strings.
All other Windows resources are stored as UNICODE strings.
DLGINIT items must be converted to the target language using a
specific code page. This is done correctly by AppTranslator.
It is required that the operating system has the same code page
when running the localized program.
For example if you localize your application to russian,
you can run it on an english Windows. All translations show correctly.
All but DLGINIT items, because those were saved as ANSI strings and have
been converted to the russian code page (1251). The english Windows has code page 1252.
It is recommended to not use DLGINIT at all, but populate list- and comboboxes
by resource strings at runtime (resource strings are always UNICODE).


Note on synchronization
-----------------------

Always do the modifications to ContaCam.apt then backport to FreeVimager.apt
by making a copy of ContaCam.apt and renaming it to FreeVimager.apt.
Open the new FreeVimager.apt, update the source file and the
output files under the Module Properties. Save it and close.
Reopen FreeVimager.apt and call Update Source.
This way around because with ContaCam we can check all the resources.
FREEVIMAGER AND CONTACAM BOTH COMMITTED MEANS THEY ARE IN SYNC!
