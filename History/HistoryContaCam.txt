VERSION HISTORY

2.0.7 (September 25th 2010)

- Improved motion detection: less sensible to luminosity changes
- New gif thumbnail message in case of system overload and
  resulting drop of frames -> lower resolution and/or framerate
  if seeing such a message in the browser while looking at the
  detections!
- Recording is less restrictive -> it's now possible to change
  many things while 24h recording
- Assistant behaves now as expected with the No change selection
- Networking fix to make it work with Wine
- Fixed motion detection and recording for the RGB16(565) format
- Fixed a tedious bug of a missing emms instruction after
  the mmx deinterlacing function call. It only happened if no
  codec was initialized
- Web interface shows now a small AVI link if both swf and
  avi files are selected for motion detection saving

2.0.1 (April 8th 2010)

- Assistant's friendly name change optimized
