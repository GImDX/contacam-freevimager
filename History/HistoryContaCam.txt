VERSION HISTORY

4.3.0 (xxx)

- For microapache set MaxKeepAliveRequests to 0 (=No Limit) to
  avoid frame jumps which were happening when the keep alive
  request count reached 0 and a reconnection was necessary
- Increased support from 15 to 100 DirectX devices
- In log messages the user assigned device name is now shown

4.1.0 (December 4th 2012)

- In the web interface it is now possible to click on the live
  image to see it in fullscreen (to get this new feature run
  the Device Assistant for each camera)
- Closing the Device Settings dialog was not always storing
  the configurations to disk
- Fixes for HTTP requests, HTTP parser and HTTP authentication
- Fixed absolute URL issues with HTTPS servers
  (thanks to Cesare Gilardi for reporting the problem)

  (thanks to Mitko for doing the translation)

4.0.9 (November 11th 2012)

- On ContaCam start the unplugged WDM devices are now popping-up
  the new error message box which permits to clear autostart

4.0.7 (November 1st 2012)

- Fixed possible timezone problems by getting browser's timezone
  and setting it in PHP
- The Other HTTP Device option of the Network dialog supports
  many more ip cameras and performs higher frame-rates because
  it first tries server push mode
- Device autostart is now not cleared when camera is unreachable
  (autostart can be removed in popping-up error message box)
- Motion detection emails include now the camera name
- Better Hotmail (Windows Live) email sending support

4.0.5 (August 27th 2012)

- In Movement Detection tab there is a new option to generate
  longer detection files so that most single detections are
  not split anymore into several movies
- The movement detection engine does now fast memory freeing
  when saving animated gifs
- Fixed crash when the detection pre-buffer is set too big
  with high resolution and high frame-rate cameras
- Optimized network buffers

  in metadata title

- Icons update

4.0.1 (July 10th 2012)

- Fixed uniqueness of temporary files
- Motion detection scheduler has now day of week check-boxes
- Allow a snapshot rate of 0 (choose Full Rate in Assistant
  Dialog) in which case the maximum possible rate is used.
  Usually that corresponds to the frame-rate, but if the
  hard-disk is slow it may be less

4.0.0 (June 15th 2012)

- Audio also for detection movies (both avi and swf files)
- It's now possible to set a relative sensibility for the single
  detection zones: set a percentage through the right-click
  context menu while in detection zones mode and then draw
- Within a day the detection movies are now tagged by a number:
  1 .. detection movies count
- Live De-Interlacing works now for all capture formats,
  no need for rec/det time De-Interlacing
- Fixed a bug in the web interface which prevented showing
  recs, detections and snapshots with the same timestamp
  (only one of them was shown)
- Introduced variables like %avi%, %gif%, %swf%, ...
  passed as parameters in command execution on detection end
- UDP networking lowered default fragment size from 1400 bytes
  to 512 bytes so that it works well for all network types

3.9.9 (May 1st 2012)

- Possibility to rotate the video source by 180°
- Moved the De-Interlace and the Rotate 180° commands from
  the Capture menu to Device Settings - General Tab
- The Device Assistant dialog was not storing the changes to the
  registry (or INI file) when pressing OK. These settings were
  not lost because ContaCam saves everything to the registry
  (or INI file) when closing

- Added support for MJPG and M420 capture device formats
- Moved Movement Detection mode selection box to bottom toolbar

  dialog box

- Manual snapshot command saves now directly to a JPG file
  (old behaviour still available through a Copy + Paste)

  of Animated GIF, AVI and JPG attachments
- Animated GIFs are now entirely stored (before this version
  the engine stopped saving with the last detection frame)
- Added client poll mode for Edimax IP cams
- Added support for TP-Link IP cams
- Motion detection command execution start can be configured:
  on first movement frame or after detection save,email,ftp
- Motion detector can now be set to: Off, Trigger File,
  Software or both
- Added a Delete Camera Folder(s) command in Tools menu
- USB and DV cams are now auto-reconnected when replugged
  (for network devices this is already the case)

3.9.0 (December 20th 2011)

- Overall speed optimizations and memory page faults reduction,
  especially the motion detection engine is now less
  CPU intensive

  begin and not on detection end as before

- 10% HD size limit check is now each 10-15 min and the
  deletion of old files is more balanced between cameras
- Updated tutorials to reflect this version 3.9.0
- Removed false detection with blue and none blue zones because 
  it could end up deleting important detections when a false
  detection occurred together with a true detection and this
  even more if it was not well configured!

  and post recording
