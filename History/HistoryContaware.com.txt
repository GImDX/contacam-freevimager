CONTAWARE.COM HISTORY 

Contaware is only me, Oliver Pfister. Conta was my nickname at the time 
of high school so that Contaware is like the stuff/things of Conta and 
also remembers the word software. 

At university I developed a graphics simulation app to verify the 
algorithm programmed for an ASIC (application specific integrated 
circuit) used together with an endoscopy camera to perform scan 
conversion and color space adaptation. In 2000 I got a Master of Science 
in Electrical Engineering from the ETH ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland. In 2001 I 
was working for a GPS modules company where I developed a simple 
graphics library + application for Windows (it was running also on 
Windows CE). From 2004 on I work as an independent IT consultant and 
around this date I also began the development of FreeVimager and 
ContaCam. As I'm very meticulous the first public release of FreeVimager 
was only in 2007 and that of ContaCam in 2010!
