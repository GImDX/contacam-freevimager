1. Open MSys Console


2. cd to ffmpeg sources:
cd /C/uimager/ffmpeg


3. Configure:

For ContaCam:
./config_lgpl_patentfree_nosnow

For RemoteCam:
./config_ocx
After make copy the libs to the RemoteCam dir!
		
For available options:
./configure --help


4. Build:
make


To Clean:
make clean
  or
make distclean -> to really start from a clean distribution


You can add the following to enable cmov and fast cmov:
--cpu=i686


Additional GPL Libs, lib sources under /usr/local/externallibs,
compiled libs will be put to /usr/local/lib (--prefix=/usr/local):
--enable-gpl
--enable-pp
--enable-swscaler
--enable-libx264
--enable-liba52     ->   For AC3 decoding
--enable-libdts     ->   Not available anymore, there is an internal dca decoder
--enable-w32threads
--enable-pthreads   ->   set this if using x264 (supports only pthreads)


Note on AC3:

in new ffmpeg AC3 decoding is available as a GPL native code,
but I could not manage to bring it to work!


Note on LibGsm:

not necessary because available as a ACM codec


Note on Ogg, Vorbis and Theora 1.0 (Theora 1.1.1 not working...):

To compile everything correctly use for all 3 libs the mingw prefix and
copy libs from /mingw/lib to /usr/local/lib and includes from /mingw/include to /usr/local/include:
./configure --enable-static --disable-shared --prefix=/mingw


Notes:

- SNOW is locking (crashing) with resolutions less than 88 x 72...
- Atrac3 leaks or even crashes if not only MMX set                 -> not compiled in
- H261, DIV3, MP4x, AP41 leak because of old init_vlc static code  -> not compiled in
- Internal DTS not working in new ffmpeg                           -> not compiled in
- zlib leaks                                                       -> not compiled in
- mpeg1 and mpeg2 leak when opened together                        -> disabled in CAVIPlay code
- vorbis internal decoder crashing on win95
- swscale doesn't support pal8 input like from CRAM 8bpp.avi. img_convert supports it!
- MPNG.avi is working with dll version, but with static it is no converting frame at 1 sec...
- I263 not working, showing only first frame
- THEORA's datarate regulator outputs keyframes with a lower quality than delta frames...
