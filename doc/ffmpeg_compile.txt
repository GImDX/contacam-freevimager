1. Open MSys Console

2. cd to ffmpeg sources (for example: cd /c/uimager/ffmpeg)

3. Configure (for available options call ./configure --help)

Edit
./config_lgpl by setting the correct prefix (for example: --prefix=/c/uimager/ffmpeg)
Run
./config_lgpl

4. Build calling: make


To Clean:
make clean
  or
make distclean -> to really start from a clean distribution


Additional GPL Libs, lib sources under /usr/local/externallibs,
compiled libs will be put to /usr/local/lib (--prefix=/usr/local):
--enable-gpl
--enable-pp
--enable-swscaler
--enable-libx264
--enable-liba52     ->   For AC3 decoding
--enable-libdts     ->   Not available anymore, there is an internal dca decoder
--enable-w32threads
--enable-pthreads   ->   set this if using x264 (supports only pthreads)


Note on AC3:

in new ffmpeg AC3 decoding is available as a GPL native code,
but I could not manage to bring it to work!


Note on LibGsm:

not necessary because available as a ACM codec


Note on Ogg, Vorbis and Theora:

To compile everything correctly use for all 3 libs the mingw prefix and
copy libs from /mingw/lib to /usr/local/lib and includes from /mingw/include to /usr/local/include:
./configure --enable-static --disable-shared --prefix=/mingw
