// Note for CreateCompatibleDC(HDC hdc):
// Windows 2000 and later: If hdc is NULL, the thread that calls CreateCompatibleDC
// owns the HDC that is created. When this thread is destroyed, the HDC is no longer
// valid. Thus, if you create the HDC and pass it to another thread, then exit the
// first thread, the second thread will not be able to use the HDC.
