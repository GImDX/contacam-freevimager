Build system
------------

Two build systems are used: Visual Studio 6 for Win9x & NT4 and
Visual Studio 2008 for Win2000 or higher (do not use Visual Studio
2010, this will not support Win2000). MFC is necessary, the express
editions are not supporting MFC natively but the library can be
obtained from alternative sources such as the free-to-download
Windows Driver Kit.

Additional requirements for Visual Studio 6:
- install sp6
- Microsoft DirectX 9.0 SDK (October 2004)
- install Platform SDK Feb 2003
- put the MASM 6.15 files (ml.err and ml.exe) to
  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\Bin
The file inclusion order under Tools - Options is:
1. DirectX  2. Platform SDK  3. Standard files 

Additional requirements for Visual Studio 2008:
- install sp1 or higher
- Microsoft Windows SDK v6.0A or higher
- Microsoft DirectX 9.0 SDK or higher

Necessary free tools:

  (needed also the nsisFirewall, KillProc and UAC plugins)
- http://upx.sourceforge.net     -> to compress the activex
