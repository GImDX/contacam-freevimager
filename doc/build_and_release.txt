Build system
------------

Two build systems are used: Visual Studio 6 to make Win9x & NT4
ANSI executables and Visual Studio 2008 to make Win2000 or higher
UNICODE executables (do not use Visual Studio 2010, this will not
support Win2000). For historical reasons the name of the project
is uImager. uImager.dsw is the Visual Studio 6 project file and
uImagervs2008.sln the Visual Studio 2008 project file.
MFC is necessary, the express editions are not
supporting MFC natively but the library can be obtained from
alternative sources such as the free-to-download Windows Driver Kit.

Additional requirements for Visual Studio 6:
- install sp6
- Microsoft DirectX 9.0 SDK (October 2004)
- install Platform SDK Feb 2003
- put the MASM 6.15 files (ml.err and ml.exe) to
  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\Bin
The file inclusion order under Tools - Options is:
1. DirectX  2. Platform SDK  3. Standard files 

Additional requirements for Visual Studio 2008:
- install sp1 or higher
- Microsoft Windows SDK v6.0A
- Microsoft DirectX 9.0 SDK or higher

Necessary free tools:

  (needed also the nsisFirewall, KillProc and UAC plugins)
- http://www.debugmode.com/wink  -> for tutorials build
