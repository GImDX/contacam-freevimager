Build system
------------

uImagervs2010.sln is the main solution file for Visual Studio 2010 which 
builds exes for XP and higher. MFC is necessary, the express editions 
are not supporting MFC natively but the library can be obtained from 
alternative sources such as the free-to-download Windows Driver Kit. 

Additional requirements for Visual Studio 2010:
- install sp1 or higher
- Microsoft DirectX 9.0 SDK or higher
  (see http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2728613 if you have problems
  installing the latest DXSDK_Jun10.exe)

Necessary free tools:
- http://www.scratchpaper.com    -> to make the Unicode NSIS installers
  (needed also the nsisFirewall, KillProc and UAC unicode plugins)
- http://www.debugmode.com/wink  -> for tutorials build

Non-free tool to make the translations:
