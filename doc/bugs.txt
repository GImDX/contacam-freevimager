Fixed Bugs:
-----------

Tooltips of bottom toolbar showing sometimes, sometimes not, MFC bug solved in vs2003 and vs2005!
The Player Slider Is Not Hovering Correctly under vs6, fixed in vs2005!



Strange Things (=not really bugs):
----------------------------------

With VS6 on Vista if opening two devices and one or both have I420 output
then the time and date are flickering...

On NT 4 and on Vista the progress when loading a big jpeg is not shown well,
this because the posted messages for the progress bar are not handled as
fast as in other OSs, or maybe they are all handled together...

3ivx D4 4.5.1 codec plays DIV3 videos only with uimager release build...

Playing raw yv12 video makes ir50_32.dll vfw codec crash when changing from
GDI RGB <-> GDI YUV rendering mode on win98 & WinMe...

On Vista when auto-starting with high priority is not working.
Probably Vista doesn't let you set high priority when starting up.

Axis 206W sometimes is violet -> It's a hardware problem

Logitech old Quickcam (Pro and Notbook) cameras at 640x480 and 4fps (or more)
change back and forth the dropped frames count...

Hauppauge WinTV PVR 350 after some time goes down to 0.2-0.8 fps, if I change the
framerate it works again for some time (usually one day).
I could detect that in the watchdog, but no, I have enough of these stupid bugs!
 


Bugs:
-----

On NT 4 after exiting fullscreen mode and if mainframe was maximized, the re-maximizing
is not exact (1-2 pixels less on right and bottom). Not a big problem. Leave it like this.

Windows Bug: Passing over a picture in Halftone mode with another window restores
the picture with the wrong stretch mode (coloroncolor) but only with small pictures (like 8x8)...

No Support For Compressing/Decompressing Unicode File Names, even new ZipArchive doesn't support it...
Zip File Specification doesn't support UNICODE...

On Safari 4 animated gifs support is buggy!!!



ffmpeg Bugs:
------------

- SNOW is locking (crashing) with resolutions less than 88 x 72...
- Atrac3 leaks or even crashes if not only MMX set                 -> not compiled in
- H261, DIV3, MP4x, AP41 leak because of old init_vlc static code  -> not compiled in
- Internal DTS not working in new ffmpeg                           -> not compiled in
- zlib leaks                                                       -> not compiled in
- vorbis internal decoder crashing on win95
- swscale doesn't support pal8 input like from CRAM 8bpp.avi. img_convert supports it!
- MPNG.avi is working with dll version, but with static it is no converting frame at 1 sec...
- I263 not working, showing only first frame
- THEORA's datarate regulator outputs keyframes with a lower quality than delta frames...



Why using ContaCam only on Win2k and higher:
--------------------------------------------

- The VC6 compile is less stable, after some month the C lib crashed!
- Micro Apache is not working on Win95
- Vorbis decoder is crashing in Win95
- On NT4 DirectX 7 is not supported
- PSAPI.dll not available on NT4 -> Micro Apache cannot be killed!
- Passwords are encrypted on Win2k or higher
- MD5 necessary for auth not available with versions less than win2k
