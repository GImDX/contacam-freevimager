Strange Things (=not really bugs)
---------------------------------

On Vista the progress when loading a big jpeg is not shown well,
this because the posted messages for the progress bar are not handled as
fast as in other OSs, or maybe they are all handled together...

3ivx D4 4.5.1 codec plays DIV3 videos only with uimager release build...

Logitech old Quickcam (Pro and Notbook) cameras at 640x480 and 4fps (or more)
change back and forth the dropped frames count...


Memory Leaks
------------

OpenSSL leaks and this is perfectly normal.  What happens is that a number of functions
are registered for a "type" (completely defined by the caller) of extra
data. This structure of pointers is then stored in a stack, and
that's what you see being allocated in your tracebacks. Since it's
meant to be possible to reuse, given an index into that stack, it's
stored globally and stays around for the lifetime of the process.


Bugs
----

Windows Bug: Passing over a picture in Halftone mode with another window restores
the picture with the wrong stretch mode (coloroncolor) but only with small pictures (like 8x8)...

No Support For Compressing/Decompressing Unicode File Names, even new ZipArchive doesn't support it...
Zip File Specification doesn't support UNICODE...
