Both
----
- When views are tiled and resizing mainframe then resize also childs
- Possibility to hide menu, statusbar, titlebars and toolbars
- Add double-quotes to ContaCam.exe file path under:
  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
- PDF manual and/or online HTML manual

ContaCam Program
----------------
- Save JPEG snapshots once the motion detection is triggered
- Document the way to have different parameters for the same cam,
  like two different snapshot rates, or ...
- Rotate by 0,90,180,270 degrees
- Make thumbnail anim. gif for mp4 records?
- Auto join with mp4box.exe all mp4 detections at the end of the day
- Ability to send different emails to different people. For example
  send GIF files to one person and JPGs to another
- For longer detection sequences introduce CDib persistence to a file
  (m_sBitsFileName set and m_pBits is NULL)
- Configurable saving frame-rate and resolution
- Allow Digital Zoom of live camera via mouse wheel
  (suggested by alanphoto@starpower.net)
- Possibility to speed-up or slow-down animated gif preview
  (mankovv@hotmail.com)
- Scheduler for emailing of detections: "I like to record all detected events,
  but I would only like to be notified of certain detections, like when I'm
  at work" (justinschmitt08@gmail.com)
- Different detection params for day and night
- Get an alert via email when an IP camera connection drops for a given
  period of time (jgminwa@gmail.com)
  
  
ContaCam Web Interface
----------------------
- Add 2 links to the "summary snapshot" web page with "previous camera"
  and "next camera" (either with text, arrow or + and -)
- Back click if in full-screen stream should return to the correct
  day and page. Not easily solvable with current frames implementation.
  I tried with clickurl=javascript:history.back() but it is only working
  well with Firefox. This problem will be solved when changing the
  ContaCam web interface to a frameless design with jquery 
- If live snapshot file time stamp remains the same then
  output a red border to alert
- Possibility to browse the detections from multiple cameras at the same
  time (suggested by alanphoto@starpower.net)
