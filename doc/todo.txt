Both
----
- Drop support for old Win9x
- When views are tiled and resizing mainframe then resize also childs
- Possibility to hide menu, statusbar and toolbars

ContaCam Program
----------------
- More compact storing in registry / ini file of detection zones
- Save JPEG snapshots once the motion detection is triggered
- Document the way to have different parameters for the same cam,
  like two different snapshot rates, or ...
- Output static .htm files through the PHP parser so that also Dropbox
  users can access it? -> to many files for all the days in a month
  and for all the pages, do not do that!
- Seems that some dynamic dns providers do html or javascript redirects:
  http://g4534.vipcam.org. Should we support that? vipcam.org is from D-Link
- Remove Tray Icon because if in service mode ContaCam sometimes is not notified
  that a user is logging-off and also the settings are not always stored well.
  Since Windows 7 the tray icons are obsolete.
- Rotate by 0,90,180,270 degrees
- Next time we update the Assistant dialog change "24h hours recording" to
  "continuous 24h hours recording"
- Think about changing Device Assistant to Device Usage, Name,
  Appearance, Storage or change it to Device Basic Settings
- Update theora or remove completely as it is not working
  anymore on vlc and mpc-hc
- Add ACTi support
  JPEG:  cgi-bin/encoder?SNAPSHOT
  MJPEG: cgi-bin/cmd/system?GET_STREAM

ContaCam Web Interface
----------------------
- Replace swf with html5 video (mp4 and webm formats)
- Back click if in full-screen stream should
  return to the correct day and page
