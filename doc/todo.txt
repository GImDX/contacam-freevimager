FreeVimager Program
-------------------
  
- Add possibility to Print all for multi-page tiff. Currently it's only 
  possible to save to pdf and print all pages from the pdf viewer.

ContaCam Program
----------------
  
- Use a Logitech C920 to implement H.264 video capture support
  -> directshow graph building for H.264 support is intentionally
  crap and difficult, not wanting to play their game...
  
- Rotate by 0,90,180,270 degrees
  (robert.heberlein@gmx.de)
  
- Possibility to speed-up or slow-down animated gif preview
  (mankovv@hotmail.com). Every animated gif stops at the end (before it
  starts over) with a pause, is it possible to make it just repeat or to
  show a countdown or just black (nedim.hodzic@gmail.com)
  
- Scheduler for emailing of detections: "I like to record all detected 
  events, but I would only like to be notified of certain detections, like 
  when I'm at work" (justinschmitt08@gmail.com) 
- Different detection params for "day and "night" and a "stay" and 
  "away" mode that you could easily switch between. Basically two 
  configuration profiles. For example, if I'm at home, I may want to 
  disable motion email alerts but have them on when I'm away. It would be 
  most convenient if you could toggle between stay/away from either the 
  software or the web interface (tyler.barnes@telus.net)
- Execute cmd and params separate for snapshots, recs start, saving done, summary 
  (chrislarsen101@gmail.com, dawsonsampson045@gmail.com)
->ALL THAT COULD BE SOLVED WITH THE POSSIBILITY TO CLONE A CAM 
  (gthumberger@gmail.com)

- Change the color and position of the date and time on the camera frame
  (toan.nguyenk@gmail.com)
  
- Post buffer is good to not split the detection, but should be removed at the
  end of the record (sambul7165@gmail.com)

- Use nmap to get all the MAC addresses and detect if one is present to disable ContaCam
  -> implement that as a ContaCam API usage example
  (stuart.les.bloom@gmail.com)
  
- Support connecting to a .m3u8 streaming server also known as HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)
  (frak@snakebite.com)
  http://bitdash-a.akamaihd.net/content/MI201109210084_1/m3u8s/f08e80da-bf1d-4e3d-8899-f0f6155f6efa.m3u8
  http://184.72.239.149/vod/smil:BigBuckBunny.smil/playlist.m3u8
  http://www.streambox.fr/playlists/test_001/stream.m3u8
  -> attention, many HLS streams are loading in bursts, we need to store pts in the frames
  
- Can you implement login log for the online viewing. So if people log 
  in to see the videos you can check in the logs which ip address and when it 
  has been logged in or tried to login (info@rwsvk.nl)
  
- Execute command on camera failure, add the option of "camera failure" to the command execute area
  (n1fbg@arrl.net)
  
- Option to record the red + blue motion grid rectangles + the red dot record symbol
  (zeroin@ya.ru, gthumberger@gmail.com, nicholas.blake.au@gmail.com)
  
- It would be helpful to have the image maybe dim, or have a message saying not connected or
  something like that if the snapshot.jpg and snapshot_thumb.jpg are too old. Implement a param
  to poll.php which returns the age of the file in seconds, so that from time to time we can
  call it through ajax and update the style of the image with:
  outline: 1px solid red; outline-offset: -1px;
  (djkothbauer@gmail.com)  
  
- Take multiple jpg snapshots on motion, not just one
  (randy3xyz@gmail.com)
  
- Delete button directly on the page where a video is displayed and
  switch to the next video as with a click on ">" (joerg@joergmahn.de)

- In web interface main view when clicking the camera thumb show it fullscreen,
  when clicking the camera name show the videos (n1fbg2@yahoo.com)
  
- Remove Interlocked... functions replacing volatile int with std::atomic<int>

- Matrix 4 command for showing also 3 cams as 4 and matrix 6 command for showing 5
  cams as 6 (engineering@theremino.com)
