ContaCam Program
----------------

- Intergrate Automatic License Plate Recognition library
  https://github.com/openalpr/openalpr (alessandro@ballerininet.eu)
  
- Use a Logitech C920 to implement H.264 video capture support
  -> directshow graph building for H.264 support is intentionally
  crap and difficult, not wanting to play their game...
  
- Rotate by 0,90,180,270 degrees

- Configurable saving frame-rate and resolution or skip excess frames
  in cases where the source doesn't listen to the requested framerate
  (chris@weldtest.com)
  
- Possibility to speed-up or slow-down animated gif preview
  (mankovv@hotmail.com). Every animated gif stops at the end (before it
  starts over) with a pause, is it possible to make it just repeat or to
  show a countdown or just black (nedim.hodzic@gmail.com)
  
- Scheduler for emailing of detections: "I like to record all detected 
  events, but I would only like to be notified of certain detections, like 
  when I'm at work" (justinschmitt08@gmail.com) 
- Different detection params for "day and "night" and a "stay" and 
  "away" mode that you could easily switch between. Basically two 
  configuration profiles. For example, if I'm at home, I may want to 
  disable motion email alerts but have them on when I'm away. It would be 
  most convenient if you could toggle between stay/away from either the 
  software or the web interface (tyler.barnes@telus.net)
- Execute cmd and params separate for snapshots, recs start, saving done, summary 
  (chrislarsen101@gmail.com)
->ALL THAT COULD BE SOLVED WITH THE POSSIBILITY TO CLONE A CAM 
  (gthumberger@gmail.com)

- Change the color and position of the date and time on the camera frame
  (toan.nguyenk@gmail.com)
  
- Post buffer is good to not split the detection, but should be removed at the
  end of the record (sambul7165@gmail.com)

- When running ContaCam from an Administrator login on a computer, if another
  person logged into that computer, the video would still get captured but audio
  from the webcam microphone would stop getting captured until that second person
  logged out. This is under Windows 10; I tried running ContaCam as a Service and
  it made no difference to this problem (shep@bostin.com)
  
- Pollable SendMailMovementDetection (nmclachlan@gmail.com)
  Pollable DoExecCommandMovementDetection (johnliber@gmail.com)
  (I do not know whether it is a good thing to add more and more pollable settings...)
  
- Implement the classic grid display for cameras overview (harmi11@gmail.com)

- Use nmap to get all the MAC addresses and detect if one is present to disable ContaCam
  (stuart.les.bloom@gmail.com)
  
- Support connecting to a .m3u8 streaming server also known as HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)
  (frak@snakebite.com)
  http://bitdash-a.akamaihd.net/content/MI201109210084_1/m3u8s/f08e80da-bf1d-4e3d-8899-f0f6155f6efa.m3u8
  http://184.72.239.149/vod/smil:BigBuckBunny.smil/playlist.m3u8
  http://www.streambox.fr/playlists/test_001/stream.m3u8
  -> attention, many HLS streams are loading in bursts, we need to store pts in the frames
  
- Can you implement login log for the online viewing. So if people log 
  in to see the videos you can check in the logs which ip address and when it 
  has been logged in or tried to login (info@rwsvk.nl)
  
- Execute command on camera failure, add the option of "camera failure" to the command execute area
  (n1fbg@arrl.net)
  
- As an option record the motion "grid" turning red along with the motion video
  (gthumberger@gmail.com)
  
- It would be helpful to have the image maybe dim, or have a message saying not connected or
  something like that if the snapshot.jpg and snapshot_thumb.jpg are too old. Implement a param
  to poll.php which returns the age of the file in seconds, so that from time to time we can
  call it through ajax and update the style of the image with:
  outline: 1px solid red; outline-offset: -1px;
