Both
----
- When views are tiled and resizing mainframe then resize also childs
- Possibility to hide menu, statusbar, titlebars and toolbars
- Add double-quotes to ContaCam.exe file path under:
  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run


FreeVimager Program
-------------------
- ...


ContaCam Program
----------------
- Save JPEG snapshots once the motion detection is triggered
- Document the way to have different parameters for the same cam,
  like two different snapshot rates, or ...
- Rotate by 0,90,180,270 degrees
- Make thumbnail anim. gif for avi records?
- Auto join all avi detections at the end of the day
- Ability to send different emails to different people. For example
  send GIF files to one person and JPGs to another
- Think about saving first to temp folder and when done moving to
  actual web folder. That to avoid fragmentation (temp folder could be
  on a SSD the other folder on a normal HDD)
  

ContaCam Web Interface
----------------------
- Add 2 links to the "summary snapshot" web page with "previous camera"
  and "next camera" (either with text, arrow or + and -)
- Replace swf with html5 video (mp4 format)
- Back click if in full-screen stream should return to the correct
  day and page. Not easily solvable with current frames implementation.
  I tried with clickurl=javascript:history.back() but it is only working
  well with Firefox. This problem will be solved when changing the
  ContaCam web interface to a frameless design with jquery 
- If live snapshot file time stamp remains the same then
  output a red border to alert
