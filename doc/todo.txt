Picture:
--------
- Using numbers to jump to a specific file in current directory

Detection:
----------
- Save also audio on detection
- Possibility to save a sequence of jpegs on detection
  or to enable snapshots only on detection
- Advanced detection scheduler with weekday selection
- Number the detections of a day starting from 1 up to ...,
  detection splits are numbered: 1, 1b, 1c, 1d

UDP Networking:
---------------
- By default set Fragment size to 512 bytes:
IPv4 and IPv6 define minimum reassembly buffer size, the minimum 
datagram size that we are guaranteed any implementation must support. 
For IPv4, this is 576 bytes. IPv6 raises this to 1,500 bytes.

This pretty much means that you want to limit your datagram size to 
under 576 if you work over public internet and you control only one side 
of the exchange - that's what most of the standard UDP-based protocols 
do. 

It is true that a typical IPv4 header is 20 bytes, and the UDP header is 
8 bytes. However it is possible to include IP options which can increase 
the size of the IP header to as much as 60 bytes. In addition, sometimes 
it is necessary for intermediate nodes to encapsulate datagrams inside 
of another protocol such as IPsec (used for VPNs and the like) in order 
to route the packet to its destination. So if you do not know the MTU on 
your particular network path, it is best to leave a reasonable margin 
for other header information that you may not have anticipated. A 
512-byte UDP payload is generally considered to do that, although even 
that does not leave quite enough space for a maximum size IP header.
