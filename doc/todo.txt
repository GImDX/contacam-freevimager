ContaCam Program
----------------
- Intergrate Automatic License Plate Recognition library
  https://github.com/openalpr/openalpr (alessandro@ballerininet.eu)
- Use a Logitech C920 to implement H.264 video capture support
  -> directshow graph building for H.264 support is intentionally
  crap and difficult, not wanting to play their game...
- Rotate by 0,90,180,270 degrees
- Configurable saving frame-rate and resolution or skip excess frames
  in cases where the source doesn't listen to the requested framerate
  (chris@weldtest.com)
- Possibility to speed-up or slow-down animated gif preview
  (mankovv@hotmail.com). Every animated gif stops at the end (before it
  starts over) with a pause, is it possible to make it just repeat or to
  show a countdown or just black (nedim.hodzic@gmail.com)
- Scheduler for emailing of detections: "I like to record all detected 
  events, but I would only like to be notified of certain detections, like 
  when I'm at work" (justinschmitt08@gmail.com) 
- Different detection params for "day and "night" and a "stay" and 
  "away" mode that you could easily switch between. Basically two 
  configuration profiles. For example, if I'm at home, I may want to 
  disable motion email alerts but have them on when I'm away. It would be 
  most convenient if you could toggle between stay/away from either the 
  software or the web interface (tyler.barnes@telus.net)
- Change the color and position of the date and time on the camera frame
  (toan.nguyenk@gmail.com)
- Advanced motion scheduler with the possibility to configure times for each day
  (g.frascarolo@tiscali.it)
- Post buffer is good to not split the detection, but should be removed at the
  end of the record (sambul7165@gmail.com)
- Execute cmd and params separate for snapshots and recs
