- Add possibility to Print all for multi-page tiff. Currently it's only 
  possible to save to pdf and print all pages from the pdf viewer.

ContaCam "will not implement" list
----------------------------------

- Use a Logitech C920 to implement H.264 video capture support
  -> directshow graph building for H.264 support is intentionally
  crap and difficult, not wanting to play their game...
  
- Rotate by 0,90,180,270 degrees
  (robert.heberlein@gmx.de)
  -> this would imply a lot of changes to the source code, it's not worth
  the effort given the fact that most cams can do that in their web interfaces
  
- Scheduler for emailing of detections: "I like to record all detected 
  events, but I would only like to be notified of certain detections, like 
  when I'm at work" (justinschmitt08@gmail.com) 
  -> on detection execute a batch file which checks the current time and
  decides whether to send the email through mailsend.exe or curl.exe
  
- Different detection params for "day and "night" and a "stay" and 
  "away" mode that you could easily switch between. Basically two 
  configuration profiles. For example, if I'm at home, I may want to 
  disable motion email alerts but have them on when I'm away. It would be 
  most convenient if you could toggle between stay/away from either the 
  software or the web interface (tyler.barnes@telus.net)
  -> detection sensitivity can be regulated through a .bat activated by the Windows Scheduler
  -> like written above email sending can be enabled at certain times
  
- Post buffer is good to not split the detection, but should be removed at the
  end of the record (sambul7165@gmail.com)
  -> a user expects the post buffer recorded to the video file
  
- Use nmap to get all the MAC addresses and detect if your phone is present to disable ContaCam
  (stuart.les.bloom@gmail.com)
  -> can be implemented with a script which calls nmap and uses CAMERA.bat to disable ContaCam
  
- Can you implement login log for the online viewing. So if people log 
  in to see the videos you can check in the logs which ip address and when it 
  has been logged in or tried to login (info@rwsvk.nl)
  -> the effort for a few which would use that is not worth
  
- It would be helpful to have the image maybe dim, or have a message saying not connected or
  something like that if the snapshot.jpg and snapshot_thumb.jpg are too old. Implement a param
  to poll.php which returns the age of the file in seconds, so that from time to time we can
  call it through ajax and update the style of the image with:
  outline: 1px solid red; outline-offset: -1px;
  (djkothbauer@gmail.com) 
  -> the live view shows the counting time stamp, it's already a good feedback
  
- In web interface main view when clicking the camera thumb show it fullscreen,
  when clicking the camera name show the videos (n1fbg2@yahoo.com)
  -> that's not intuitive, with the first click you get to the 12 thumbs and
  with the second one you are already in the fullscreen live view
  
- Matrix 4 command for showing also 3 cams as 4 and matrix 6 command for showing 5
  cams as 6 (engineering@theremino.com)
  -> that can be achieved manually with the snapping borders functionality
  
- In root index.php scale all thumbs to the same size so that they get arranged 
  nicely in a grid
  (wally.malicki@gmail.com)
  -> thumb size is taken from cam's configuration.php, to which size should we scale all thumbs?
  Usually all thumbs are the same size so it's not worth the effort of doing that for a rare case
  
- I would like to be able to click on the trash can and the files are deleted without the extra
  step of the confirmation dialog. Make that configurable under Camera Basic Settings
  (brucebeauchamp100@gmail.com)
  -> it's just a click, not worth to clutter the settings to remove an important alert message

- Possibility to speed-up or slow-down animated gif preview
  (mankovv@hotmail.com). Every animated gif stops at the end (before it
  starts over) with a pause, is it possible to make it just repeat or to
  show a countdown or just black (nedim.hodzic@gmail.com)

- Change the color of the date and time on the camera frame
  (toan.nguyenk@gmail.com, thomas.hendrik@adick.de)
  
- Support connecting to a .m3u8 streaming server also known as HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)
  (frak@snakebite.com)
  http://bitdash-a.akamaihd.net/content/MI201109210084_1/m3u8s/f08e80da-bf1d-4e3d-8899-f0f6155f6efa.m3u8
  http://184.72.239.149/vod/smil:BigBuckBunny.smil/playlist.m3u8
  http://www.streambox.fr/playlists/test_001/stream.m3u8
  -> attention, many HLS streams are loading in bursts, we need to store pts in the frames
  
- Execute command on camera failure, add the option of "camera failure" to the command execute area
  (n1fbg@arrl.net) 
  
- Take multiple jpg snapshots on motion, not just one
  (randy3xyz@gmail.com)
  
- Delete button directly on the page where a video is displayed and switch to the
  next video or go back
  (joerg@joergmahn.de, gthaavik@outlook.com)
  
- More fine tunable relative sensitivity, maybe instead of fixed relative sensitivity,
  make them configurable in absolute value or relative. 
  Important to remain backwards compatible!
