Picture:
--------
- Using numbers to jump to a specific file in current directory
- When image is shown press F2 and "Rename" window appears

Detection:
----------
- Save also audio on detection
- Possibility to send 3x jpegs by email on detection
- Possibility to save a sequence of jpegs on detection
  or to enable snapshots only on detection
- Advanced detection scheduler with weekday selection
- Have an option to monitor every say 2, 4 or 8 frames instead
  of every frame -> this would be less cpu hungry

Video:
------
- VfW save with CAVIFile is crappy: files bigger than 1GB are not supported,
  files which do not have a VfW decompressor are not saved, it crashes
  all the time... Eventually add ICCompress to CAVRec, but do not integrate
  CAVIPlay into CAVIFile it is to complicated, especially because of audio!
