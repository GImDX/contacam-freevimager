ContaCam Program
----------------
- Intergrate Automatic License Plate Recognition library
  https://github.com/openalpr/openalpr (alessandro@ballerininet.eu)
- Use a Logitech C920 to implement H.264 video capture support
  -> directshow graph building for H.264 support is intentionally
  crap and difficult, not wanting to play their game...
- Rotate by 0,90,180,270 degrees
- Configurable saving frame-rate and resolution or skip excess frames
  in cases where the source doesn't listen to the requested framerate
  (chris@weldtest.com)
- Possibility to speed-up or slow-down animated gif preview
  (mankovv@hotmail.com). Every animated gif stops at the end (before it
  starts over) with a pause, is it possible to make it just repeat or to
  show a countdown or just black (nedim.hodzic@gmail.com)
- Scheduler for emailing of detections: "I like to record all detected 
  events, but I would only like to be notified of certain detections, like 
  when I'm at work" (justinschmitt08@gmail.com) 
- Different detection params for "day and "night" and a "stay" and 
  "away" mode that you could easily switch between. Basically two 
  configuration profiles. For example, if I'm at home, I may want to 
  disable motion email alerts but have them on when I'm away. It would be 
  most convenient if you could toggle between stay/away from either the 
  software or the web interface (tyler.barnes@telus.net)
- Change the color and position of the date and time on the camera frame
  (toan.nguyenk@gmail.com)
- Advanced motion scheduler with the possibility to configure times for each day
  (g.frascarolo@tiscali.it)
- Post buffer is good to not split the detection, but should be removed at the
  end of the record (sambul7165@gmail.com)
- Execute cmd and params separate for snapshots and recs
- When running ContaCam from an Administrator login on a computer, if another
  person logged into that computer, the video would still get captured but audio
  from the webcam microphone would stop getting captured until that second person
  logged out. This is under Windows 10; I tried running ContaCam as a Service and
  it made no difference to this problem (shep@bostin.com)
- Suggestion to make priority configurable: "High, Normal or Low" in Global Settings
  dialog (admin@denied.gr)
- Pollable SendMailMovementDetection (nmclachlan@gmail.com)
  Pollable DoExecCommandMovementDetection (johnliber@gmail.com)
  (I do not know whether it is a good thing to add more and more pollable settings...)
- Implement the classic grid display for cameras overview (harmi11@gmail.com)
- Opera mobile can't play video records from web server page. I made also tests with other
  sources of mp4 and also with them there are problems. So we wait that Opera fixes it
  (a_adashkevich@mail.ru)
- Use nmap to get all the MAC addresses and detect if one is present to disable ContaCam
  (stuart.les.bloom@gmail.com)
- Support connecting to a .m3u8 streaming server also known as HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)
  (frak@snakebite.com)
  http://bitdash-a.akamaihd.net/content/MI201109210084_1/m3u8s/f08e80da-bf1d-4e3d-8899-f0f6155f6efa.m3u8
  http://184.72.239.149/vod/smil:BigBuckBunny.smil/playlist.m3u8
  http://www.streambox.fr/playlists/test_001/stream.m3u8
  -> attention, many HLS streams are loading in bursts, we need to store pts in the frames
- If we could delete (recycle) all files shown on the current page of the web interface by
  clicking just one button or implement a multi-selection delete.
  Skip empty days in web interface, up to let's say one month or more (reini703@gmx.ch)
- Can you implement login log for the online viewing. So if people log 
  in to see the videos you can check in the logs which ip address and when it 
  has been logged in or tried to login (info@rwsvk.nl)
- Execute command on camera failure, add the option of "camera failure" to the command execute area
  (n1fbg@arrl.net)
