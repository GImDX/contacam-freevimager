Both
----
- Drop support for old Win9x
- When views are tiled and resizing mainframe then resize also childs
- Possibility to hide menu, statusbar and toolbars

ContaCam Program
----------------
- More compact storing in registry / ini file of detection zones
- Remove Avi Play feature because vlc can be used to stream a avi
  file to multipart/x-mixed-replace mjpeg
- Start deleting files from MIN(10% of HD space, 10 GB) -> in Device
  Assistant write 'if the free disk space is getting low...'
- Save JPEG snapshots once the motion detection is triggered
- Document the way to have different parameters for the same cam,
  like two different snapshot rates, or ...
- Output static .htm files through the PHP parser so that also Dropbox
  users can access it? -> to many files for all the days in a month
  and for all the pages, do not do that!
- Seems that some dynamic dns providers do html or javascript redirects:
  http://g4534.vipcam.org. Should we support that? vipcam.org is from D-Link
- Remove Tray Icon because if in service mode ContaCam sometimes is not notified
  that a user is logging-off and also the settings are not always stored well.
  Since Windows 7 the tray icons are obsolete.
- Rotate by 90 degrees
- Add support for new Foscams:
  JPEG:  /cgi-bin/CGIProxy.fcgi?cmd=snapPicture2
  MJPEG: /cgi-bin/CGIStream.cgi?cmd=GetMJStream

ContaCam Web Interface
----------------------
- Replace swf with html5 video (mp4 and webm formats)
- Find a way to show avi detections if only avi selected
- Find a way to show swf detections if only swf selected

ContaCam internet site
----------------------
- Write on main page that's possible to remotely watch through port forwarding or Dropbox
