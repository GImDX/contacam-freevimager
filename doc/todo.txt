Wishes from Yuriy:
------------------
- zoom should change "custom" or use steps 10%

Picture:
--------
- Using numbers to jump to a specific file in current directory

Detection:
----------
- Possibility to send 3x jpegs by email on detection
- Advanced detection scheduler with weekday selection
- Have an option to monitor every say 2, 4 or 8 frames instead
  of every frame -> this would be less cpu hungry

Video:
------
- VfW save with CAVIFile is crappy: files bigger than 1GB are not supported,
  files which do not have a VfW decompressor are not saved, it crashes
  all the time... Eventually add ICCompress to CAVRec, but do not integrate
  CAVIPlay into CAVIFile it is to complicated, especially because of audio!
