Wishes from Yuriy:
------------------
- zoom should change "custom" or use steps 10%

Picture:
--------
- Vale PC first load gravidanza-portraits pictures is not sharp:
  maybe set JPEG_FULL_IMAGE_LOAD_START_WAITTIME to 500 and
  check whether the loaded size is enough. We could also
  sharp a bit the preview (if that's not to slow...) and
  make the fade-in a bit faster
- Using numbers to jump to a specific file in current directory

Translations:
-------------
- Translate AVI Info
- Translate Fit, Fit Big and the percents

Detection:
----------
- SMS send if detection with an external program, see naughter

Video:
------
- VfW save with CAVIFile is crappy: files bigger than 1GB are not supported,
  files which do not have a VfW decompressor are not saved, it crashes
  all the time... Eventually add ICCompress to CAVRec, but do not integrate
  CAVIPlay into CAVIFile it is to complicated, especially because of audio!
