- VfW save with CAVIFile is crappy: files bigger than 1GB are not supported,
  files which do not have a VfW decompressor are not saved, it crashes
  all the time... Eventually add ICCompress to CAVRec, but do not integrate
  CAVIPlay into CAVIFile it is to complicated, especially because of audio!
