Picture:
--------
- Using numbers to jump to a specific file in current directory

Detection:
----------
- Save also audio on detection
- Possibility to send 3x jpegs by email on detection
- Possibility to save a sequence of jpegs on detection
  or to enable snapshots only on detection
- Advanced detection scheduler with weekday selection
- Have an option to monitor every say 2, 4 or 8 frames instead
  of every frame -> this would be less cpu hungry
