Picture:
--------
- Using numbers to jump to a specific file in current directory

Detection:
----------
- Possibility to send 3x jpegs by email on detection
- Possibility to save a sequence of jpegs on detection
- Advanced detection scheduler with weekday selection
- Have an option to monitor every say 2, 4 or 8 frames instead
  of every frame -> this would be less cpu hungry

Email sending on detection:
---------------------------
- Make dual file compilation for vc6 and vc2008 (add static openssl libs to
  vc2008 project) with the new naughter classes supporting STARTTLS and SSL
  but not supporting vc6 so that we have STARTTLS and SSL on Win2000 and higher

- VfW save with CAVIFile is crappy: files bigger than 1GB are not supported,
  files which do not have a VfW decompressor are not saved, it crashes
  all the time... Eventually add ICCompress to CAVRec, but do not integrate
  CAVIPlay into CAVIFile it is to complicated, especially because of audio!
