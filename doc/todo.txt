Both
----
- When views are tiled and resizing mainframe then resize also childs
- Add double-quotes to ContaCam.exe file path under:
  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

ContaCam Program
----------------
- Intergrate Automatic License Plate Recognition library
  https://github.com/openalpr/openalpr (alessandro@ballerininet.eu)
- Use a Logitech C920 to implement H.264 video capture support
  -> directshow graph building for H.264 support is intentionally
  crap and difficult, not wanting to play their game...
- Save JPEG snapshots once the motion detection is triggered
- Rotate by 0,90,180,270 degrees
- Ability to send different emails to different people. For example
  send GIF files to one person and JPGs to another
- Configurable saving frame-rate and resolution
- Allow Digital Zoom of live camera via mouse wheel
  (suggested by alanphoto@starpower.net)
- Possibility to speed-up or slow-down animated gif preview
  (mankovv@hotmail.com). Every animated gif stops at the end (before it
  starts over) with a pause, is it possible to make it just repeat or to
  show a countdown or just black (nedim.hodzic@gmail.com)
- Scheduler for emailing of detections: "I like to record all detected 
  events, but I would only like to be notified of certain detections, like 
  when I'm at work" (justinschmitt08@gmail.com) 
- Different detection params for "day and "night" and a "stay" and 
  "away" mode that you could easily switch between. Basically two 
  configuration profiles. For example, if I'm at home, I may want to 
  disable motion email alerts but have them on when I'm away. It would be 
  most convenient if you could toggle between stay/away from either the 
  software or the web interface (tyler.barnes@telus.net)
- Black squares where no detection and where image is obscured with black
  pixels (jeanbaptiste.guyot@orange.fr) or crop regions to also reduce the
  saving cpu usage (dodfr@yahoo.com)
- Add detection grid layer drawing over recorded video file that will show
  the square(s) that triggered the detection so it would help to fine tune
  motion detection grid/sensitivity when first days videos are recorded
  (dodfr@yahoo.com)
- Checkbox in Camera Basic Settings to remove the files also from the FTP
  server (jeanbaptiste.guyot@orange.fr)
- Change the color and position of the date and time on the camera frame
  (toan.nguyenk@gmail.com)
- Snapshot and continuous recording schedulers like detection scheduler


ContaCam Web Interface
----------------------
- Password protect cameras with PHP session and not with apache
- Number of detections in index.php at the bottom of each preview for
  quick reference on which cameras have had detections in last 24 hours
  (pauls583@yahoo.com.au)
- In index.php when clicking on live thumb open fullscreen and when
  clicking text open detections (matthewn_02@yahoo.com)
- If live snapshot file time stamp remains the same then output a red
  border to alert
- Possibility to browse the detections from multiple cameras at the same
  time (suggested by alanphoto@starpower.net)
