I currently have 3 license agreements with the MPEG LA for H264,  
MPEG-2 and MPEG-4.  The cost is almost ZERO so it's really worth  
signing up.

Here's the break down of my costs:

1) H264 - 100,000 units a year = free
2) MP4 - 50,000 units a year = free
3) MPEG-2 - $2.50 off every unit

Ok, so what does UNIT mean?  Unit means for every ENCODER and DECODER  
I build and sell has a monetary price.  I don't plan to sell more  
than 5000 units a year so H264 and MP4 are free indefinitely for me.   
So why sign up?  Because the MPEG LA will protect me from ANYONE  
claiming to own the IP on ANY portion of my encoder/decoder.  For  
instance, there is *NO* ownership of the H263 format yet the header  
is nearly identical to MP4, the MPEG LA will actually protect me from  
anyone claiming to own H263 even though they don't.  I have the in  
writing from the MPEG LA, but at the same time it means there are  
lots of yahoo's out there that WILL claim ownership of H263 just to  
squeeze your balls.

It's damn cheap and took a week for them to FedEX the papers to me  
and have the signed.  I don't know why more people aren't signing up  
to cover their assess.

Here is a portion of the H263 explanation I got from the MPEG LA group:

===============================================================
With regard to H.263, MPEG LA does not offer a license specifically  
for H.263 and I am not aware of any patent pool arrangement that has  
been established for H.263. That said, please permit me to provide a  
bit of background and summarize MPEG LA's position insofar as our  
MPEG-4 Visual Patent Portfolio License is concerned.

As we previously discussed on the phone, an H.263 Baseline signal and  
an MPEG-4 Visual Short Header signal are technically identical and  
indistinguishable. In addition, MPEG-4 Visual with Short Header is a  
subset of the MPEG-4 Visual Simple Profile. As a result, an MPEG-4  
Visual decoder that is capable of decoding a Simple Profile signal  
will decode an H.263 Baseline signal generated by an H.263 Baseline  
encoder. Similarly, an MPEG-4 Visual Short Header signal generated by  
an MPEG-4 Visual Simple Profile encoder can be decoded by an H.263  
Baseline decoder.

Therefore, if a royalty is paid on an H.263 Baseline encoder or H.263  
Baseline decoder (for example, if a product includes an H.263  
Baseline encoder/decoder and a Licensee to our MPEG-4 Visual License  
pays royalties on such product under the MPEG-4 Visual License), such  
product will be viewed as licensed in accordance with the terms of  
the MPEG-4 Visual Patent Portfolio License.
