Tell the 32-bit OS to increase the amount user-mode memory from 2GB to 3GB
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Not necessary for 64-bit OS as LARGEADDRESSAWARE 32-bit apps automatically
  use the full 4GB address space
- On Windows XP or 2003 put the /3GB switch into boot.ini and reboot
- For Vista or higher run the following from the Command Prompt
  as Administrator and reboot:
  bcdedit /set IncreaseUserVa 3072
  to disable:
  bcdedit /deletevalue IncreaseUserVa

  
Considerations to make sure that the code can handle addresses larger than 2GB
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Check all pointer subtractions and verify the result is stored
  in a type which can contain the possible difference, or replace
  them with comparisons or other constructs
- Make sure you are not assuming pointers have Bit31 zero, do not attempt 
  to use Bit31 for something else 
- Some dll's will be loaded just under the 2GB boundary. In this case,
  no consecutive memory can be allocated with VirtualAlloc()
- Use GlobalMemoryStatusEx() to retrieve memory sizes
- Replace all GetCursorPos() calls with GetCursorInfo() as on some systems
  it fails for addresses > 2GB

- To force allocations to allocate from higher addresses before lower 
  addresses, specify MEM_TOP_DOWN when calling VirtualAlloc or set the 
  following registry value to REG_DWORD 0x100000 and reboot: 
  HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management\AllocationPreference


Linker option in the Visual Studio
----------------------------------

- Open the project's Property Pages dialog box
- Click the Linker folder
- Click the System property page
- Modify the Enable Large Addresses property


Enable LARGEADDRESSAWARE for an application
-------------------------------------------

Open the "Visual Studio Command Prompt" console from the start 
menu, and CD into prog.exe's dir:
editbin /LARGEADDRESSAWARE prog.exe

disable it:
editbin /LARGEADDRESSAWARE:NO prog.exe


Verify if LARGEADDRESSAWARE is in effect
----------------------------------------

Open the "Visual Studio Command Prompt" console from the start 
menu, and CD into prog.exe's dir:
dumpbin /headers prog.exe | more
