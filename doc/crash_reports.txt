CRASH REPORTS

13.04.2010
----------

Previous and first start of ContaCam 2.0.1 (before it was ContaCam 2.0.0) at 
at 23:20:22 on 09.04.2010.

ContaCam crashed running from the service and was restarted by the service
at 22:51:24 on 13.04.2010. 

At that time only decoding of the polled jpegs was enabled (no snapshots, no recording):

- It could be the network parser
- It could be the ffmpeg mjpeg decoder, PROCESSOR_BUFFER_PADDING_SIZE is 16 in NetCom.h like FF_INPUT_BUFFER_PADDING_SIZE
- It could be the delete thread which runs each 3 hours, but because ContaCam was started
  at 23:20:22 on 09.04.2010 it doesn't seem to be a multiple of 3 hours...
