- The Zip Extract Here can be called by right-clicking
  a zip file and selecting the Extract Here Menu entry.
  Zip Files must be associated with the Program!

- If The Zip File Has a Unique Top Folder it is used
  as the starting folder for extraction:
  Current Zip File Folder\Top Folder\...

- On the other side if no Unique Top Folder is found a Top
  Folder is created (if at least 2 files are stored inside
  the zip file) using the Zip File Name without extension:
  Current Zip File Folder\Zip File Name No Extension\...

- On existing files (not folders!) a dialog is popped-up
  prompting the user to make a choice: Replace, Replace All,
  Rename, Rename All or Cancel the Extraction.
